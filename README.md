This repository contains Python code snippets that cover various fundamental concepts for data science.

### 1. Variables and Data Types:
   - Demonstrates the creation and manipulation of variables of different data types.
   - Uses functions like type(), len(), split(), and print() to work with variables.

### 2. Lists:
   - Shows how to create and manipulate lists.
   - Uses list slicing, appending, removing, and concatenation.

### 3. IF and For-Loop Statements:
   - Introduces conditional statements and loops.
   - Uses if-else statements and for loops to perform tasks like checking values and printing numbers.

### 4. Functions:
   - Define and calls functions to perform specific tasks.
   - Introduces function parameters and docstrings.

### 5. Dictionaries:
   - Demonstrates working with dictionaries and their methods.
   - Shows how to add, update, and remove items from dictionaries.

### 6. Classes, Objects, Attributes, and Methods:
   - Introduces the concept of classes and objects.
   - Defines a Book class with attributes and methods for updating book prices.

### 7. Importing Modules:
   - Demonstrates importing modules such as random, math, and statistics.
   - Uses these modules for tasks like generating random numbers and performing mathematical calculations.
